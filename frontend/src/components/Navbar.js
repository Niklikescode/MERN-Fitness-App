// The selected code is a JavaScript file that uses the React library and the react-router-dom package to define a Navbar component.

// At the top, there's an import statement that imports the Link component from the 'react-router-dom' package. The Link component is used to create links in your application that interact seamlessly with the react-router's Router.

// The Navbar function is a functional component in React. This component represents a navigation bar in the application. Inside the Navbar component, a header HTML element is returned. This header element is typically used to contain navigation links or introductory content.

// Inside the header element, there's a div element with a class of "container". This class is likely used for styling purposes, perhaps to control the layout or appearance of the container.

// Within the div element, there's a Link component with a to prop set to "/". This creates a link to the root path of the application. When clicked, this link will navigate to the home page without causing a full page refresh, thanks to the HTML5 History API used by react-router.

// Next to the Link component, there's an h1 element that contains the text "Workout Tracker". This is likely the title of the application, which will be displayed in the navigation bar.

// Finally, the Navbar component is exported as the default export of the module. This means that it can be imported in other files using an import statement without curly braces.
